      Users will have the ability add profile picture, and a coverp photo to their eego. We want users to be proud
      of their collections, so we are adding the ability to share them. Keeping track of the people users like the most
      can be difficult so we want to give users the ability to "follow" others. We are experimenting with the word
      "watching" because it feels less social. The eego logo mark will direct the user to a feed of collected content
      from people the user is "following" or "watching"... more coming soon on this :)
