      Currently working with Brendan Luu to create a web virtual reality exhibition. We are exploring creating an exhibit on
      the topics of art and music. Our goal is to create an experience that makes virtual reality more enjoyable
      for those who don't have access to all of the hardware needed to use VR. For this reason we are creating a web experience.
      I have been learning how to create VR experiences with A-Frame. Check out a prototype I have created of Mr. Yuk
